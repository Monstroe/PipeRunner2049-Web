# PipeRunner2049 Web Interface

Created for the [Joint Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/joint-jam-2024) Game Jam. Created a virtual reality horror game called [Pipe Runner 2049](https://joseph-demartini.itch.io/pipe-runner-2049) within a 48-hour timeframe. Alongside the VR game, a web interface allowing external users to manipulate the VR player's game in real-time was also developed. This repository contains the code for the web interface.

## Technologies Used

### VR Side
* [Unity](https://unity.com/) - Game Engine
* [C# .Net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/) - Language

### Web Side
* [React](https://react.dev/) - Front-End
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Back-End
* [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - Authentication
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language

### Current Status
Admittedly, due to the time constraints of the game jam, this web component is in an early stage of development (i.e. barely functional). Maybe I will expand on this project in the future, but probably not.

I had initially planned to incorporate Socket.IO for real-time communication but was unable to get it to work properly. That is the main point of improvement for this project.
